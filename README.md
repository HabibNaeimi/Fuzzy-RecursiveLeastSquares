# Fuzzy Recursive Least Squares Algorithem
 Design of Fuzzy System Using Recursive Least Squares Algorithm
- Prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series.
- Development of no conflict rule base and customization of the project for any membership function,
fuzzy system, and inference engine types.
- The algorithm implements in MATLAB using Fozzy Logic Toolbox.

This program was developed as a course project for Fuzzy systems course by Habibollah Naeimi.
